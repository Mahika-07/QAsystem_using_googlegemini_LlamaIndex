In Reynosa, Mexico, across the bor der \nfrom McAllen, Texas, another 3,273 migrants are waiting at Senda De \nVida shelters, according to pastor Hector Silva, who runs the facilities. \nAnd in nearby Matamoros, Mexico, about 4,000 migrants are living in \ncamps, shelters, and abandoned homes, says  Glady Ca\u00f1as who runs \nnonprofit Ayudandoles a Triunfar.  \nThe waiting migrants feel \u201cdesperate,\u201d according to Ca\u00f1as \u2013  but many \nhave put trust in mechanisms like the CBP One app, which automates \nscheduling appointments to claim asylum with border patrol, she said.  \nIn recent weeks, US border cities have struggled under the weight of an \nunprecedented surge of people crossing into the US from Mexico. \nFederal authorities reported a seven- day average of more than 9,600 \nmigrant encounters along the US southern border in D ecember, CNN \nreported Friday. For comparison, the seven- day average reported on \nNovember 28 was about 6,800 encounters.  \nAccording to Ca\u00f1as, three migrants drowned in the Rio Grande in the \nMatamoros area December, but people continue to try to cross the river \ndespite the lethal dangers.

Since May, the US Department of Homeland \nSecurity has deported or returned over 445,000 migrants \u2013  the vast \nmajority of whom had crossed the US Southern border, the agency  said \nonline. \nThe federal government has also closed ports of entry in multiple states \nand reassigned personnel to transport and process migrants as it \ngrapples with ways to maximize its limited resources. The Biden \nAdministration also temporarily suspended rail operations in Eagle Pass \nand El Paso, but those services resumed Friday.  \nOne group of migrants that had been waiting in cold temperatures in \nEagle Pass, Texas, has been cleared and processed within the past \ncouple of days,  but US Customs and Border Protection is not out of the \nwoods yet from the ongoing border surge, a senior C BP official told \nCNN Monday.  \nThe official said that many steps, including increasing resources, were \ntaken to address the challenge the agency faced in Eagle Pass last \nweek, when CNN witnessed thousands of migrant families waiting \noutside to be transported to immigration processing facilities.  \nDespite the improved scene in Eagle Pass, illegal crossings continue, \nthe same official said, and are being fueled by bad actors who push \nmigrants to enter the US southern border between ports of entry, \nincluding rural areas of Arizona.  \nCNN has also learned large groups of migrants continue to arrive at the \nborder by train. According to Sister Isabel Turcios, the director of a \nmigrant shelter in Piedras Negras, Mexico \u2013 which is across the border \nfrom Eagle Pass \u2013  about 1,000 migrants arrived by train Monday.
