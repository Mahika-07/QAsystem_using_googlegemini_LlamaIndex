Those outcomes  will depend heavily on the storm\u2019s timing, \nintensity and track, which are still highly uncertain given the system \nresponsible for it is still thousands of miles away, off the West Coast of \nthe US.  \nWhat is known is that an active Pacific storm track typical of  an El Ni\u00f1o \nwinter will send a series of storms across the US into next week, \npresenting the highes t chance for impactful snow so far this winter in \nsome of the country\u2019s most populous areas on the East Coast.  \nThe system responsible for the potential winter weather will first cross \nthe southern half of the US through Friday, before swooping up the \nEast through the weekend.  \nIn much of the South this will mean a cool rain. Eastern Texas, \nLouisiana and southern Mississippi, all still suffering from drought after \na summer of extreme heat and a lack of rain, are in the bull\u2019s -eye for \nwhat would be largely beneficial rain.  \nRain will begin Thursday evening in eastern Texas and progress with \nthe storm\u2019s track to the east, overrunning the Southeast and parts of the \nmid-Atlantic with time. This storm could cause flooding issues in the \nSouth, particularly in areas that get drenched on Tuesday and \nWednesday by another wet system.  \nConfidence in the storm\u2019s exact track drops after it leaves  the \nSoutheast.
